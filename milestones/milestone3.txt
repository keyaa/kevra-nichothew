--- Milestone 3 ---

Our selected database is MariaDB (same syntax as mySQL), using the XAMPP stack (Apache + MariaDB + PHP)

The tables are organized with the objective of being able to categorize user/employee information, as well as
having past orders, and of course all of the available food items.

There is an ER Diagram named "milestone3_ERdiagram.png" in this milestones folder, outlining what tables/columns we have.
Scripts to set up the database + tables and to populate them can be found under the "scripts" folder.
