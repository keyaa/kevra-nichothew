CSCI 3308 Semester Project

(Milestone 1 below)

Team Name: 
    Take a Hike
Members: 
    Kira Johnson
    Nicholas Mozdzier
    Kevin Yang 
    Matthew Penington
Description: 

    Our desired final product will allow people in Boulder to schedule hikes together, by choosing a date, time, and trail. Users will be able to provide a short description of themselves, contact details, food to bring, post pictures, rate trails/people?, possibly have a forum for hiking discussion, etc.

    A user could sign up as a person or with a few friends (more social/safer), view trail traffic (how many people signed up to hike a certain trail at a certain date), and possibly view profiles/pictures of other hikers. We hope that this will encourage people to be more active and meet new people with common interests.

Vision Statement:
    People should have a way to meet with other active people in Boulder who want to share their love of hiking.

Motivation:
    While many people flock to Boulder's many trails to get away from society, it would be nice to be able to connect with new and interesting friends while partaking in a hobby those people share. With the Take a Hike website, Boulderites will be able to connect with each other, schedule hikes, look up the best trails, and get the most out of the great outdoors.

Risks:
    - short time frame (combined with other school work, will be difficult)
    - no team members have experience with creating forums
    - little webdev experience
    - no database experience

Risk Mitigation Plan:
    We will start with a very barebones structure (in order to ensure that we complete the project within the deadline), then add more features as we go along (agile methodology).

Version Control:
    Github: https://github.com/nmozdzier/kevra-nichothew

Development Method:
    Agile/Scrum, weekly meetings to see what was done, what needs to be done, and what is currently in progress. Features and progress will be discussed as a team each meeting.

Collaboration Tool:
    Slack

Proposed Architecture:
    Backend: SQL, Google Maps API
    Frontend: HTML/CSS/Javascript
    Communicate between: PHP/Python
    Technologies: SQL -> database queries, HTML/CSS/Javascript -> website app, PHP/Python -> request data and bring to form/vice versa
