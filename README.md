CSCI 3308 Semester Project

(Milestone 1 below)

Team Name: WeatherTech Cafe Online Ordering

Members: Kevin Yang, Kira Johnson, Matthew Penington, Nicholas Mozdzier (Kevra Nichothew)


Description: 
	Our project will ideally provide a website for CU Boulder’s own WeatherTech Cafe from which users will be able to order food online and view a menu, optimized for both computer and phone use (it does not currently have one). We have not spoken to WeatherTech regarding this website yet and don’t plan to involve them until later in the project when most of the backend is complete in order to avoid unnecessary problems for us as this is first and foremost a project that we will receive a grade for. However, we will still design the website utilizing their menu and branding if they decide to 
	Online ordering is especially important for the WeatherTech Cafe because ordering a pizza or calzone can usually take upwards of 25-30 minutes to prepare and students often don’t want to or have enough time to order these items. This would also speed up the often long line that is present during peak eating hours. This should theoretically increase business for the WeatherTech Cafe as well. 
	We will not be incorporating any sort of online payments for this project due to their complexity and potential security concerns. If time allows we will work with WeatherTech to provide a system where users can place orders and pay when they come to pick up the food.

Vision Statement:
	Our team could make a lasting impact on CU Boulder and its future students by providing a desired service that is not currently offered in the form of a website for WeatherTech Cafe that allows users to order food in advance.

Motivation:
	Many people (including Nick’s co-workers) on campus would love a way to order food online from WeatherTech Cafe that is otherwise inaccessible to them due to the long wait times for some of the restaurant’s most popular items: pizzas and calzones. 

Risks: This project was selected in part because it minimizes risks involved, which is especially important because our team only has 4 members who all have fairly limited experience with programming. We think designing most of the project will be pretty straightforward. The biggest challenge will be working with WeatherTech Cafe to get it actually implemented since we will be dealing with additional interests beyond the project requirements.

Risk Mitigation Plan:  We have put a lot of thought and several hours of group discussion into deciding on an idea that was manageable in size and that everyone agreed upon while still meeting the project requirements. During the initial discussion, we decided against making a phone app or game to not add any additional difficulty to an already relatively inexperienced team. We are saving working with WeatherTech until then end so that we will still have something that meets the requirements of the class and are completely avoiding online payment to avoid the added complexity. 

Version Control: GitHub (and Google Drive for the writing and presenting stuff)

Development Method: 
Our team will utilize agile/scrum alongside Trello to manage tasks. We feel our core feature set should provide us with enough to do for the whole semester and we can add additional features to the website outside of online ordering and connecting with Weather Tech if necessary. We have been meeting every Friday evening right after class for a weekly scrum since groups were assigned.

Collaboration Tool: Slack

Proposed Architecture: 
The frontend will consist of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The backend will consist of a mySQL database for user accounts and menu ordering and PHP will do the in-between communication.
